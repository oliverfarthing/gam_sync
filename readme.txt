Version 2.1 Author Oliver Farthing

Prerequisites
Root Folder: Ensure that the root folder is located at C:\gamsync.
GAM Advanced: A functional version of "GAM Advanced" must be installed in the directory C:\gamadv-xtd3.#

Components (Essential files for this service)
gamsync_mastersync.BAT: Initiates a new synchronisation process.
mastergamsync.csv: Contains the primary database of all "user" objects retrieved from "GAM Advanced".
gamsync_maintenance.BAT: Executes maintenance tasks to consolidate all actions performed by this tool.
*sync.csv: Files matching this pattern are processed by gamsync_export.BAT. These files include the results of synchronisation operations.
*syncvalidation.csv: Files with this pattern are used to validate the current state of objects. They are pulled into arrays for validation purposes.
gamsync_*query.ps1: Processes data from mastergamsync.csv and determines the contents of *sync.csv.
gamsync_export.BAT: Processes data from the addition and subtraction databases and sends them to the GAM Advanced to send the updates to google.

Changes
31/07/24 - Version 2.1
NXTS query added, new query which has updated framework. Improveing response times.

30/07/24 - Version 2.0
Redesigned the script to handle each query independently, allowing each query to manage its own validator arrays separately. This adjustment supports the "activemailbox" function, which operates independently of any domain-specific logic. Additionally, i have moved the exporting functionality to a separate batch file (mastersync.bat). This change separates data processing from data exporting, improving the modularity and maintainability of the script. Each query now handles its own data processing, and the mastersync.bat file takes care of exporting the results. This separation ensures better flexibility and organization in the scriptâ€™s operation.
